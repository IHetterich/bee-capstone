# CCD and the Recovery of American Bees

## Overview
Colony Collapse Disorder, or CCD, is a phenomenon where the majority of the worker bees in a colony will suddenly disappear. This disappearance is incredibly damaging for the hive and the grand majority do not survive. While many reports suggest that CCD has afflicted hives for well over a century (there are reports matching the description back to 1869) it has only come into the public eye in the last 20 or so years. This is mainly due to much higher observed rates in the 1990's through the mid 2000's leading up to the actual classification and naming of the disorder in 2006. To this day the actual cause of CCD is unknown, there are several theories but no concrete facts beyond its existence and devastating effects.

Bees of course play in incredibly vital role in their ecosystems as pollinators. We additionally rely on domestic hives to pollinate our crops and produce honey. So when CCD flared up and was officially classified many people sounded the alarm so to speak. Major efforts were instituted by the EPA to track and study both domestic and wild colony health. Thankfully over time the rate of CCD appeared to slow, many reports have even stated that the American Honey industry is recovering, leading to the following questions.

## Questions
- How have domestic bee populations responded after the uptick in CCD?
- If they are recovering to what extent can we see that?
- More than just the colonies, how has the honey industry been effecting in the wake of this colony die-off?
